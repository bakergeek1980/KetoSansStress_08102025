The trajectory outlines the evolution of the KetoSansStress app, starting from an AI engineer's initial build to my current work. A major initial challenge involved persistent non-editable input fields on the web, leading to a significant architectural shift from  for login/registration to local  with a new  component. This also necessitated refactoring  to manage separate loading states.

Throughout the process, the application faced recurring compilation issues and Preview Unavailable errors, primarily due to Expo package version incompatibilities and ngrok tunnel failures, which often hampered real-time testing. Despite these environment hurdles, core frontend logic fixes and new feature implementations progressed.

User requests during this phase introduced substantial feature enhancements: a complete Mon Profil page with tabs, dynamic user information (full name, editable birth date instead of age), a robust profile picture upload system, and a direct account deletion mechanism. Backend schema and API endpoints were updated accordingly, along with new SQL scripts for Supabase. The trajectory concludes with the ongoing implementation of the profile picture interface and the integration of birth date into the profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the requested profile page enhancements. This involved modifying  to align with the user's vision for a modern Mon Profil interface.

Specific actions included:
1.  **Removing the redundant avatar display**: The green circle (an older avatar placeholder) from the  in  was identified and removed from the JSX.
2.  **Enhancing the primary profile picture section**: The existing  was targeted for improvement, with new styles being applied to make it more visible and functional for photo uploads.
3.  **Integrating the birth date field**: The  field in the profile form within  was replaced with the new  component, reflecting the user's requirement to store  instead of . This also involved updating the  interface to include .
4.  **Applying new styles**: Specific CSS styles were added/updated in  to support the enhanced photo section.
5.  **Adding necessary imports**: The  component was imported into .

The most recent action was to add  to the initialization of the profile data state in , ensuring that existing user birth dates (if available) would pre-populate the field. The application compiles, and the structural changes for the profile interface are in progress.
